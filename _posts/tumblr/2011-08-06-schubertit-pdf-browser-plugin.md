[Schubert-it PDF Browser Plugin][1] ☹️ Dead URL

It&#8217;s back (and just in time). This plug-in makes EMBEDed PDF files
in Safari 5+ and Firefox work!

Update 1/21/2012: While this saved me from no reading of PDF files, it did not
work correctly for some pdf files that were embedded within a larger page.
Eventually Apple fixed their stuff and Safari worked again with this plugin.
